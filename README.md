# Logbook

This is web application for students and professors of medical studies. It is used to track students achievements through study.

There are 3 roles in application
Admin - He is authored to add new users 
Professor - He can see list of students and patients.
Student - He can add new patients and see list of patients.

I made it using MEAN stack, so frontend is Angular based, server is Node.js and MongoDB as database.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Run

First start liveserver for an app.
	**ng serve**

Then navigate to the **backend** folder and start server which will be connected to the database automatically
  **node app.js**

## Usage

To use this app you have to be logged in.
For admin login use email: admin@logbook.com and password: admin
For professor login use email: professor@logbook.com and password: professor
For student login use email: student@logbook.com and password: student

## Note

You can try features, add new users and patients, but every 1. of the month database will be cleared, so you will not be able to make a login with your previous credentials.
